# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äç Mission & Vision

I am an agronomist with experience in research and stakeholders education, underpinning the development and recommendation of the best crop management practices for productive, efficient, and environmentally safe farming systems. My passion and expertise are in cropping systems, soil fertility and crop nutrition, and applied computer programming to put modern data analytics and digital solutions to the service of agriculture. I aim to play an active role in transdisciplinary projects that gather diverse agricultural stakeholders.

## üéìEducation

-   Ph.D., Agronomy. Kansas State University. 2021.

-   MS, Soil Science. Universidad de Buenos Aires. 2018.

-   BS, Agronomy. Universidad de Buenos Aires. 2011.

## üåΩInterests

Sustainable Farming \| Crop Nutrition \| Data Science \| Digital Solutions

A great crop hides a whole story of questions underneath. Curiosity drives farmers, agronomists, and scientists to achieve improvements in our farming systems and communities.

-   **Research**: Dynamic future scenarios require research exploring the interactions between plant genetics (G), environment (E), and crop management (M).

-   **Extension**: By addressing stakeholders' concerns we visualize research gaps, we facilitate the right development and adoption of technologies, and we also enhance productivity and the resources use efficiency.

-   **Education**: Leaders of the farming of the future require transdisciplinary work and education that provides them the tools to efficiently utilize multiple data sources for decision-making.
