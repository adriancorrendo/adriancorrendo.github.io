Hi, there! My name is Adrian Correndo. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I live with my wife (Milagros) and our little girl (Amelie) in Manhattan, Kansas, USA, where I obtained my Ph.D. in Agronomy in 2021.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Kansas State University collaborating on various research projects, education, and outreach activities, with special focus on digital support tools for corn and soybean crops.

My mission is to substantially contribute to the development and transfer of science for sustainable farming systems.

Teamwork is my favorite word, an essential part of my professional and personal philosophy. I work to inspire and support the future leaders of agriculture.

## 👷🏻What do I do?

I work to identify and promote best management practices for cropping systems at multiple scales. I heavily rely my work on applied statistics and reproducible programming to develop accessible and cross-scale digital tools that put modern data analytics (e.g. Machine Learning, Bayesian stats) to the service of our communities.
