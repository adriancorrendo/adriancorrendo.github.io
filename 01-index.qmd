## üåΩInterests

Sustainable Farming \| Crop Nutrition \| Data Science \| Digital Solutions

A great crop hides a whole story of questions underneath. Curiosity drives farmers, agronomists, and scientists to achieve improvements in our farming systems and communities.

-   **Research**: Dynamic future scenarios require research exploring the interactions between plant genetics (G), environment (E), and crop management (M).

-   **Extension**: By addressing stakeholders' concerns we visualize research gaps, we facilitate the right development and adoption of technologies, and we also enhance productivity and the resources use efficiency.

-   **Education**: Leaders of the farming of the future require transdisciplinary work and education that provides them the tools to efficiently utilize multiple data sources for decision-making.
