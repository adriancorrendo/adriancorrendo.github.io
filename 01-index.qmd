| Hi, there! My name is Adrian Correndo. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I live with my wife (Milagros) and our little girl (Amelie) in Manhattan, Kansas, USA, where I got my Ph.D. in Agronomy in 2021.
| 
| Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Kansas State Univeristy collaborating on various research projects and outreach activities, with special focus on digital support tools for corn and soybean crops.
| 
| My mission is to substantially contribute to the development and transfer of science for sustainable farming systems.
| 
| Teamwork is my favorite word, an essential part of my professional and personal philosophy. I work to inspire and support the future leaders of agriculture.

## üë∑üèªWhat do I do?

I work to identify and promote best management practices for cropping systems at multiple scales. I heavily rely my work on applied statistics and reproducible programming to develop accessible and cross-scale digital tools that put modern data analytics (e.g. Machine Learning, Bayesian stats) to the service of our communities.

On my [Career](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/02-career.html) section you will find details on my professional life, experience, and interests.

My [Publications](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/03-publications.html) section provides a summary the diverse type of literature material I have produced during my career.
