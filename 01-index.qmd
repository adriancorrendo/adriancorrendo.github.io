| Hi, there! My name is Adrian Correndo. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since 2018, I live with my wife (Milagros) and our little girl (Amelie) in Manhattan, Kansas, USA.
| 
| My mission is to contribute to the development and transfer of science for sustainable farming systems. Thus, I dedicate my career to develop decision support tools that hasten the adoption of sustainable management practices for agriculture.
| 
| I make use of applied statistics and programming to develop digital tools that put modern data analytics to the service of cropping systems, soil fertility and crop nutrition.

## 🌽Interests

Sustainable Farming \| Crop Nutrition \| Data Science \| Digital Solutions

A great crop hides a whole story of questions underneath. Curiosity drives farmers, agronomists, and scientists to achieve improvements in our farming systems and communities.

-   **Research**: Dynamic future scenarios require research exploring the interactions between plant genetics (G), environment (E), and crop management (M).

-   **Extension**: By addressing stakeholders' concerns we visualize research gaps, we facilitate the right development and adoption of technologies, and we also enhance productivity and the resources use efficiency.

-   **Education**: Leaders of the farming of the future require transdisciplinary work and education that provides them the tools to efficiently utilize multiple data sources for decision-making.
