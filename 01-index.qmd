# üôãüèª Bio

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
Hi, there! My name is Adrian Correndo. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I live with my wife (Milagros) and our little girl (Amelie) in Manhattan, Kansas, USA, where I got my Ph.D. in Agronomy in 2021.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Kansas State Univeristy collaborating on various research projects and outreach activities, with special focus on digital support tools for corn and soybean crops.

My mission is to substantially contribute to the development and transfer of science for sustainable farming systems.

Teamwork is my favorite word, an essential part of my professional and personal philosophy. I work to inspire and support the future leaders of agriculture.

## üë∑üèªWhat do I do?

I work to identify and promote best management practices for cropping systems at multiple scales. I heavily rely my work on applied statistics and reproducible programming to develop accessible and cross-scale digital tools that put modern data analytics (e.g. Machine Learning, Bayesian stats) to the service of our communities.

On my [Career](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/02-career.html) section you will find details on my professional life, experience, and interests.

My [Publications](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/03-publications.html) section provides a summary the diverse type of literature material I have produced during my career.

If you're interested in my digital developments, my [Digital Resources](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/03-digitalops.html) section includes links to my R-packages ( [*soiltestcorr*](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/soiltestcorr/), [*metrica*](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/metrica/)*, [XPolaris](https://cran.r-project.org/package=XPolaris)*), Shinyapps (user-friendly interfaces), digital repositories, and YouTube tutorials.
