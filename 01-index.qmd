# 🙋🏻 Bio

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
| Hi, there! My name is Adrian Correndo. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since 2018, I live with my wife (Milagros) and our little girl (Amelie) in Manhattan, Kansas, USA.
| 
| My mission is to contribute to the development and transfer of science for sustainable farming systems. Thus, I dedicate my career to develop decision support tools that hasten the adoption of sustainable management practices for agriculture.

## 👷🏻What do I do?

I make use of applied statistics and programming to develop digital tools that put modern data analytics (e.g. Machine Learning, Bayesian stats) to the service of cropping systems, soil fertility and crop nutrition.

On my [DigitalOps](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/04-digitalops.html) section you may find my most recent developments including R-packages ([soiltestcorr](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/soiltestcorr/) and [metrica](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/metrica/)) and Shinyapps (user-friendly interfaces) that facilitate end users taks.

## 🌽Interests

Sustainable Farming \| Crop Nutrition \| Data Science \| Digital Solutions

A great crop hides a whole story of questions underneath. Curiosity drives farmers, agronomists, and scientists to achieve improvements in our farming systems and communities.

-   **Research**: Dynamic future scenarios require research exploring the interactions between plant genetics (G), environment (E), and crop management (M).

-   **Extension**: By addressing stakeholders' concerns we visualize research gaps, we facilitate the right development and adoption of technologies, and we also enhance productivity and the resources use efficiency.

-   **Education**: Leaders of the farming of the future require transdisciplinary work and education that provides them the tools to efficiently utilize multiple data sources for decision-making.
